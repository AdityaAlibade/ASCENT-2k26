Create a full-screen Squid Game system loader.
BACKGROUND:
- Pure black background
- Subtle noise / film grain
- Very faint vignette around edges
CENTER ELEMENT:
Three large white symbols displayed horizontally:
◯   △   □
Each symbol has:
- Clean geometric stroke
- Small neon-pink dot acting as a status indicator
- SVG-based animation (sharp, smooth, precise)
ANIMATION SEQUENCE (looping):
1. Circle draws itself clockwise
   → pink dot blinks once
2. Triangle draws itself edge by edge
   → pink dot blinks once
3. Square draws itself last
   → pink dot stays solid
Stroke animation feels mechanical, not playful.
SOUND DESIGN:
- Soft electronic hum
- Subtle digital ticks synced with stroke completion
- No music yet
TEXT (small, bottom-center, mono font):
"System Check in Progress"
No buttons.
No scrolling.
No user interaction.
This screen must feel like a controlled surveillance system,
not a website loader.

After the loading screen, play a full-screen cinematic video.
VIDEO CONTENT:
- Close-up shot of hands playing ddakji on the ground
- Realistic paper slaps and echoing sound
- Slow motion as one ddakji card flips over
- Background fades to black at the moment of the flip
At the exact moment the card lands face-up:
- Cut instantly to a dark screen
- A low bass hit plays
WELCOME ANIMATION:
- Large white text fades in slowly:
  "WELCOME."
- Followed by pink text:
  "YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED."
- Subtext appears beneath in smaller grey font:
  "This is your invitation to the Squid Game."
- Background music begins:
  Use Squid Game OST
  (Mingle Game Song “Round and Round” OR Jump Rope Song, low volume)
A single button fades in:
[ CONFIRM ]
Button glow pulses slowly in pink.
No other navigation.

On clicking [CONFIRM], transition with a sharp sound cue.
SCENE:
- Dark control room environment
- Large screens flickering in the background
- The Front Man appears at the center (silhouette or masked figure)
- No visible face details, only authority
TEXT DELIVERY:
The Front Man does NOT speak aloud.
His message appears as animated white subtitles, line by line:
"Participants will compete in a series of challenges."
"Each round will test intelligence, speed, and composure."
"Failure is elimination."
"Success moves you forward."
Background music lowers slightly during text display.
After the final line:
- Silence for 1 second
- A confirmation button fades in:
[ ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS ]
Button is white with subtle red warning glow.

When the user clicks [ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS]:
- A warning overlay flashes briefly in red
- Alarm tone plays once (short, not loud)
Text appears:
"By proceeding, you agree to the rules of the game."
Below it, a final button:
[ ENTER THE GAME ]
Once clicked:
- Transition to registration / player onboarding
- Assign a player number dynamically
- Display confirmation:
"You are now a registered player."
Fade out music.
