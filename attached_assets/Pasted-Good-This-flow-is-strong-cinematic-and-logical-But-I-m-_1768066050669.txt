Good. This flow is **strong**, cinematic, and logical.
But I’m going to be blunt first, then give you **elite-level prompts**.

### Brutal truth first (important):

Your idea only works if:

* Transitions are **tight** (no delays, no jank)
* Each step has **clear user intent** (Confirm → Continue → Accept)
* You **don’t over-explain** with text (Squid Game is minimal, cold, threatening)

If you add extra fluff, narration, or long paragraphs — you’ll kill the tension.

Now, here’s the **BEST-IN-CLASS PROMPTS**, step by step.
You can paste these **directly** into an AI website builder / animation generator / creative tool.

# 🔴 STEP 1 — DDAKJI LOADING SCREEN (ENTRY)

### 🎯 Goal

User feels like they just entered the Squid Game system.

---

### 🔥 PROMPT — STEP 1

```
Create a Squid Game–themed loading screen.

The screen is dark with a subtle grain texture.
A traditional Korean ddakji card appears at the center.

ANIMATION:
- The ddakji card slowly rotates and flips in place
- Each flip produces a soft paper-slapping sound
- A faint spotlight follows the card
- Background has low ambient tension sound

TEXT (minimal, bottom-center):
"Initializing Selection Process..."

No buttons.
No interaction.
This screen lasts 3–4 seconds only.

The loading must feel deliberate, eerie, and official — not playful.
```

# 🔴 STEP 2 — DDAKJI VIDEO → WELCOME SCREEN

### 🎯 Goal

Transition from **real-world game** → **system confirmation**

---

### 🔥 PROMPT — STEP 2

```
After the loading screen, play a full-screen cinematic video.

VIDEO CONTENT:
- Close-up shot of hands playing ddakji on the ground
- Realistic paper slaps and echoing sound
- Slow motion as one ddakji card flips over
- Background fades to black at the moment of the flip

At the exact moment the card lands face-up:
- Cut instantly to a dark screen
- A low bass hit plays

WELCOME ANIMATION:
- Large white text fades in slowly:

  "WELCOME."

- Followed by pink text:

  "YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED."

- Subtext appears beneath in smaller grey font:

  "This is your invitation to the Squid Game."

- Background music begins:
  Use Squid Game OST
  (Mingle Game Song “Round and Round” OR Jump Rope Song, low volume)

A single button fades in:
[ CONFIRM ]

Button glow pulses slowly in pink.
No other navigation.
```

⚠️ **Important:**
The timing between card flip → text must be **instant**.
No fade lag. This is where most people mess it up.

# 🔴 STEP 3 — FRONT MAN INTRODUCTION (CONCEPT EXPLANATION)

### 🎯 Goal

Make the event feel **official, controlled, and unavoidable**

---

### 🔥 PROMPT — STEP 3

```
On clicking [CONFIRM], transition with a sharp sound cue.

SCENE:
- Dark control room environment
- Large screens flickering in the background
- The Front Man appears at the center (silhouette or masked figure)
- No visible face details, only authority

TEXT DELIVERY:
The Front Man does NOT speak aloud.
His message appears as animated white subtitles, line by line:

"Participants will compete in a series of challenges."

"Each round will test intelligence, speed, and composure."

"Failure is elimination."

"Success moves you forward."

Background music lowers slightly during text display.

After the final line:
- Silence for 1 second
- A confirmation button fades in:

[ ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS ]

Button is white with subtle red warning glow.
```

---

# 🔴 STEP 4 — FINAL CONFIRMATION (POINT OF NO RETURN)

### 🎯 Goal

This is the **psychological lock-in** moment.

---

### 🔥 PROMPT — STEP 4

```
When the user clicks [ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS]:

- A warning overlay flashes briefly in red
- Alarm tone plays once (short, not loud)

Text appears:

"By proceeding, you agree to the rules of the game."

Below it, a final button:

[ ENTER THE GAME ]

Once clicked:
- Transition to registration / player onboarding
- Assign a player number dynamically
- Display confirmation:

"You are now a registered player."

Fade out music.
```
